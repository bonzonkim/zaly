# Extend zaly

Start with the smallest mechanism that fits the job:

| Need | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Explain how a project should be worked on | [Project instructions](./instructions.md) |
| Reuse a prompt with arguments or shell context | [Custom commands](./commands.md) |
| Format command inputs and conditional text | [Templates](./templates.md) |
| Teach a reusable workflow loaded on demand | [Skills](./skills.md) |
| Execute custom integration logic | [Plugins](./plugins.md) |
| Distribute resources together | [Resource packs](./plugins.md#resource-packs) |

User resources apply across projects; project resources travel with a repository.
See [resource discovery](../configuration/resources.md) before choosing where to
put them.

Keep prompts focused. A short instruction or command is often more maintainable
than a plugin. Conversely, use code when something needs deterministic behavior
rather than hoping the model will consistently implement it.

::: warning Trust
Commands can execute shell snippets, and plugins execute code. Read resources
before enabling them. Do not assume the agent's tool permissions sandbox extension
code or template evaluation.
